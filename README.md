## General Information
- I used various technologies in my projects.
- These are one of the first more important individual projects.
- The projects contain issues related to (solve the problem): the use of Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy libraries for preliminary data preparation, the use of predictive models, data visualization.
- The aim of each project was to practice selected tools for working with a data set.
- Various analytical problems require the use of many specific tools. I made an effort to learn a few tools supporting work with the dataset and programming languages.


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.7
- RStudio - version 1.3.1093
- R - version 4.0.3
- Databricks - version 4.3


## Screenshots

## Project Status
All projects are completed.


## Room for Improvement
The designs are simple and clear. It is necessary to introduce changes and improve the existing solutions. However, they can be an inspiration for the development of the issues under consideration.

Room for improvement:
- Database update for the projects "Hotel booking analysis" and "Predictive analysis of COVID-19 incidence".
- Use of advanced data visualization techniques in the R programming language.


## Acknowledgements
- These projects are only my own creativity.
- Many thanks to my academic teachers who gave me a lot of practical knowledge and inspired me to continue my development towards data analysis.
